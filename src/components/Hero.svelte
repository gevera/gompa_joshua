		Truth or Consequences is a small town that is relatively remote. The Rio Grande runs through the
		town and because of the water source and large aquifer combined with volcanic and tectonic plate
		activity underground, there are natural hot springs in the town. This natural wonder has lead T
		or C to have a rich history of spiritual practice and healing, and for centuries indiginous
		peoples valued this area as a place of peace and restoration, Notably this land was a retreat
		area used by the medicine man, Geronimo and to this day there are many people from indigious and
		non-indigious lineages continuing to be in spiritual relationship with this unique place.

		Gompa Apartments is located in a quiet street, but also in the center of town, there is a great
		view of Turtleback mountant from most of the units. We provide small efficiency and one bedroom
		apartment rentals for short term or longer term visitors. We also have some units available
		through the Air BnB website. This is ideal for people who want to do secluded spiritual
		practices and retreats, or just vacation and visit the hot springs and enjoy the nearby Elephant
		Butte Lake State park. Its a great place to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life.
