		Truth or Consequences is a unique small city in southern New Mexico. It is relatively remote
		location not close to many other cities, and so it is able to maintain its own character. The
		Rio Grande runs through the city and because of the water source and large aquifer combined with
		volcanic and tectonic plate activity underground, there are natural hot springs in the down town
		area. This natural wonder has lead T or C to have a rich history of spiritual practice and
		healing, and for centuries indigenous peoples valued this area as a place of peace and
		restoration. Notably this land was a retreat area used by the medicine man, Geronimo. To this
		day there are many people from indigenous and non-indigenous lineages continuing to be in
		spiritual relationship with this unique place.

		Gompa Apartments is located in a quiet street, but also in the center of town, there is a great
		view of Turtleback mountain from most of the units. We provide small efficiency and one bedroom
		apartment rentals for short term or longer term visitors. We also have some units available
		through the AirBnB website. This is ideal for people who want to do secluded spiritual
		practices and retreats, or just vacation and visit the hot springs and enjoy the nearby Elephant
		Butte Lake State park. It's a great place to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life.
