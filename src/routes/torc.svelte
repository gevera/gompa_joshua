	<h1>Truth or Consequences</h1>
	<Frame>
		<p>
			In 1949 the radio Ralph Edwards’ popular game show, “Truth or Consequences,” was having it’s
			10th anniversary, and the producers of the show had the idea to find a town or city somewhere
			in America that would be willing to change its name to ‘Truth or Consequences,’ and then the
			show sould do the anniversary broadcast from that city. A number of cities responded. But Hot
			Springs, New Mexico was chosen. Why? Because it seemed to embody the same philosophy as Ralph
			Edwards and his show – namely, “A real friendliness for people and a desire to help mankind.”
			The city had the means to carry out this creed due to numerous local resources: its healing
			hot springs, the Carrie Tingley Hospital for Crippled Children (now the New Mexico State
			Veterans Home), a pleasant climate, close proximity to Elephant Butte Lake, and the genuine
			western hospitality of the people.
