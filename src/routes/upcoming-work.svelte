				Heaven is our big vision and the realm of vast possibilities. Earth in this case is the Gompa
				Apartments, the land and buildings and properties and its resources. Human is our volunteers
				and human practicality and ability to bring the two (heaven and earth together) grow food,
				build buildings and healthy societies. Humankind is the medium of that cultivation.

			<Frame>
				<p>
					We have a big vision for Gompa Apartments over the long haul helping many people live in a
					sustainable and more balanced healthy way. We want to be a place of good karma
					contributing to the community and benefit of all our relations. This big vision is
					accomplished joyfully step by step and it takes the coming together of people with this
					shared approach to living life intentionally and fully, independently growing and learning
					together.

					What we need to do to transform a regular apartment complex into a mindfully based health
					and sustainably oriently community center?
				</p>
				<p>
					#1 Power transformation:<br /> In NM we have almost 365 days of great sun. We will have our
					own solar power on all the building roof structures and also on the covered walkways. We are
					deciding weather to build our own battery storage out of recycled lithium batteries and/or
					also feed power back into the grid. We will be charging our electric bikes and vehicles with
					the power from the sun.
				</p>
				<p>
					#2 Renovating the Original historic building. <br />
					The original building, which faces south on 4th street has 5 apartments numbers 1 - 5. This
					oldest section was likely constructed in the 1920s; Originally in the winter it was probably
					heated with wood burning stoves. It was built with bricks that look like they were either taken
					from the Elephant Butte Dam project completed in 1918 or made locally on site. The exterior
					of all the buildings needs painting and a few friends have volunteered to do the final decorative
					style painting on the porch pillars and the side moldings around the building in a Tibetan
					Gompa style.
				</p>
				<p>
					In either the late 1940’s or early 1950’s 3 more apartments were added that we call the
					newer addition extending the L shape to have a bout equal length on both wings. The 3
					bedroom house was also built at that time.
				</p>
			</Frame>
		</div>
		<h2 id="names">We’ve named each apartment a fun name related to its number or purpose.</h2>

		<div id="eight">
			<Frame>
				<p>
					APT #8. We call this apartment <span>the Infinite wash room</span>. <br />It is one of the
					larger studio apartments. It is currently used for storage but a few years ago it had a
					tenant renting it. It's pretty large but instead of using it for a residential apartment
					we are going to transform it into a laundry room and community computer room. This weill
					create more space in the main house by moving the laundry room from the main house into
					#8. We also want to create a door to the back yard in #8 for tenants and guests to have an
					easier way to access that nice shaded back area of the property from the laundry room. We
					are also adding a computer work station and having a lending library shelf to this public
					space. We will also have bookshelves for lending library and a printer and office supplies
					for tenants and guests. Second we want to add a nice insulated wall to make half of #8
					into a “keep it simple '' quiet area/meditation hall. It can be a room where a person can
					just be in silence. Its a “keep it simple” space, an open room without furniture and with
					a few meditation cushions and yoga mats in it on the floor. We plan to line the walls with
					cedar planks which have a nice smell and quality very different than most of the adobe and
					stone walls and it will have a very clean and uplifting feeling. #8 is called the infinite
					wash room because, not only can you do your laundry in half, the apartment, but you can
					wash your mind in the keep it simple room. We want to start with #8 as the first project.
				</p>
			</Frame>
		</div>

		<div id="six">
			<Frame>
				<p>
					APT #6. We call this apartment <span>The Secret corner</span> <br />
					The corner one bedroom apartment, and it is the only one bedroom in the older section of the
					building. Because it is a one bedroom and has a very functional quiet unique layout it would
					be great for visiting Asian Doctors teachers, honored guests. This Apartment needs new flooring
					and painting and little patchwork here and there. It has been used as a crash pad for work-stay
					people already so it is functional but not at the level it can be at so we would like to put
					it more on the top of the list for remodel. It is probably the easiest to remodel.
				</p>
			</Frame>
		</div>
		<div id="three">
			<Frame>
				<p>
					APT #3. This apartment is called <span>Magic 3</span><br />

					We just cleared out #3 as it was used as a storage unit for the last 40 years and other
					than newer electricity, it has not been upgraded in its style since the 1940’s. So this
					one needs a total facelift. That means totally new floors throughout the back wall patched
					newly built kitchen counter and sink area. This will take more work but it is also up
					there in our priorities probably equal to #6 in importance since it is on the wing of the
					building more for Tenants it would be great to rent it out to a local person for income
					for the property and to pay for more remodeling of the other units.
				</p>
			</Frame>
		</div>
		<div id="four">
			<Frame>
				<p>
					Apartment #4 is called <span>4 Immeasurables</span> <br /> It has always had very compassionate
					tenants, but one just had to move so it is empty. It needs remodeling but it is functional
					for guests at the moment.
				</p>

				<p>
					It is on the wing of the building that is great for local tenants to rent but it needs to
					be cleaned and maybe repainted, but it is more or less ready to rent out to the right
					person.
				</p>
			</Frame>
		</div>
		<div id="seven">
			<Frame>
				<p>
					Apartment #7, is called <span>Lucky #7</span> <br />
					It will eventually be converted to a bunk bed style dorm room area. It needs remodeling but
					it is functional and one of the larger studio type apartments.
				</p>
			</Frame>
		</div>

		<div id="main_house">
			<Frame>
				<p>
					Main house. We call this <span>The Holistic House</span>. <br />The laundry room is half
					of what used to be a converted garage. Will be moving the laundry room to #8 and rejoining
					that room with the rest of the garage space to become a large bedroom. The rear secondary
					kitchen will be fixed up. The front of the house will have an asian medicine herbal supply
					store and waiting room for acupuncture and herbal patients. It will also have an eating
					area for sharing food after cooking classes. The middle acupuncture treatment room will
					stay the same but a room in the front will be added for a second acupuncture treatment
					room. We will be taking away the middle west facing bedroom to be able to enlarge the
					kitchen in the mail house. The entire house needs reflooring and or carpeting depending
					what room and other slight repairs. The attic needs floor boards and more insulation in
					some spot which will allow for a lot of storage space. The house has a great structure and
					one the laundry room is moved, the back area will be its own separate living space or
					“grandma apartment,” with its own bedroom bathroom and separate kitchen,
				</p>

				><p>
					6 of the other apartments are not being remodeled. #1 <span>The outpost</span>, #2
					<span>Deuces are wild</span>, #5 <span>Rainbow Energy</span>, #9
					<span>Transcendent Beatles</span>, #10 <span>Ordinary Ground</span>, and #11
					<span>Liberty Palace</span>. All but one of these, Transcendent Beatles, are currently
					occupied by local tenants and they want to continue renting and will not be getting any
					renovations at this time. So right now we only have #9 open for guests and visitors, and
					although they are up for remodeling and not as nice #4 and #6 and #7 are also open for
					helpers to stay in while we work to upgrade one step at a time.

		</div>
		<div id="back">
			<Frame
				><p>
					Back of property. The north side we hope to a have a roofed walkway, which add another 10
					feet extending out from the buildings roof. We will make it out of used solar panels (we
					know where to get them) it is north, On opposite side of walk way facing south we will add
					a few storage sheds rentable to tenants. Thus this sort of encloses the walkway and
					provides shade to the back of the building and protect the building from storms. The north
					side building is very strong and has survived well for almost 100 years but the outer
					screens on the rear windows often get blown off by the wind. This roofed walkway will
					serve all these functions to add value to the property. We will add gravel to get rid of
					the goat head weeds back there the walk way will go all the way to the west back yard. One
					the West side behind the building there are nice shaded trees and we hope to make that a
					nice common area to have for a secluded relaxation in the shade to read books and so on.
					It will have nice garden, grass or stone patio, especially behind #8. On the corner
					between the west and east we might at times put up an above ground pool with a salt water
					system for soaking and bathing.
				</p></Frame

		</div>

		<div id="solar">
			<Frame
				><p>
					Solar Arrays for electric bike charging. All the buildings on the property have great
					durable metal roofs and on them we want to add solar. We also might create our own battery
					banks to charge our electric bikes and vehicle conversions and provide free electricity to
					the apartments. Whether this extra energy connects at all to the grid or not or we just
					use it ourselves is to be determined. We have already repurposed old microwave
					transformers to make lithium battery bank welders when constructing lower price ebike
					batteries. There are a few different types of lithium battery chemistries and we will
					decide what kind of battery banks and do a cost analysis of which will be best for our
					purposes and best to recycle older lithluim batteries. Having battery banks also helps
					everyone here and the larger community if ever in emergencies the city power is disrupted.
				</p>
			</Frame>
		</div>

		<div id="redesign">
			<Frame
				><p>
					Redesigned front entrance way to parking lot and a few minor landscape tweeks. We want to
					build some kind of roofed entrance gate, like a Japanese Sanmon, however it can be very
					simple. We want to add some more decorative planters at the entrance area, and paint the
					totally sun faded sign to say GOMPA APARTMENTS.
				</p></Frame
			>
		</div>

		<div id="repaint">
			<Frame
				><p>
					Repainting outside of all the buildings. We are keeping the white color theme on all the
					apartments, but changing the boarder colors to a faded orange. And the main house we are
					painting that faded orange color. We will use decorative art on the posts and boarder
					accents, maybe more of a tibetan or asian style motif. A friend from boulder has
					volunteered to do some of that specialty artistic painting.

				The authentic culture of man articulates the resources of energy and intelligence as an
				appropriate response to the dominion of heaven and earth. It is said that when human culture
				is in accord with the principles of heaven and earth then the four seasons and the other
				elements also will work together in harmony. This is the deep spiritual ecology. According
				to these teachings, mankind can overcome fear and strife and celebrate our destiny by
				finding our place in the primordial order of heaven and earth. For more on these Ancient but
