			<Frame>
				<p>
					Why do I describe all the renovations plans below? Because this website acts as a
					communications tool for both the breadth of the bigger vision and the smaller details.. So
					if you are a possible work stay person thinking of visiting or helping here you can know
					what we are working on. So let's get right down to the real nitty gritty and into what
					projects we are doing.

		<div id="original">
			<Frame>
				<p>
					The original building, which faces south on 4th street has 5 apartments numbers 1 - 5.
					This oldest section was likely constructed in the 1920s; but the property records in the
					town records do not go back that far to give a construction date. It was built with bricks
					that look like they were either taken from the Elephant Butte Dam project or made locally
					on site. A lot of the original building in T or C came from the construction site of the
					Elephant butte Dam. When the dam was finished in 1918 many of the houses were put on
					barges and floated down the river from the dam site to the town site. The bricks could be
					from those elephant butte constructions. The original building was 5 apartments but 3 more
					(#6 #7 and #8) were added on with mostly the same bricks in the same construction style
					creating the L shape. All the apartments 1-5 are cuter small studio apartments. #6 7 & 8
					are a bit larger ##6 on the corner is a 1 bedroom. Since 6,7 and 8 are made of the same
					materials in the same style this was probably done also in the 1920’s not long after the
					original building was made, In either the late 1940’s or early 1950’s 3 more apartments
					were added that we call the newer addition extending the L shape to have a bout equal
					length on both wings. The 3 bedroom house was also built at that time. All the buildings
					have metal roofs and are either made from the original bricks or the cinderblocks. So the
					building itself is very durable and long lasting.

		<h2 id="names">We’ve named each apartment a fun name related to its number or purpose.</h2>

		<div id="eight">
			<Frame>
				<p>
					APT #8. We call this apartment <span>the Infinite wash room</span>. <br />It is one of the
					larger studio apartments. It is currently used for storage but a few years ago it had a
					tenant renting it. It's pretty large but instead of using it for a residential apartment
					we are going to transform it into a laundry room and community computer room. This weill
					create more space in the main house by moving the laundry room from the main house into
					#8. We also want to create a door to the back yard in #8 for tenants and guests to have an
					easier way to access that nice shaded back area of the property from the laundry room. We
					are also adding a computer work station and having a lending library shelf to this public
					space. We will also have bookshelves for lending library and a printer and office supplies
					for tenants and guests. Second we want to add a nice insulated wall to make half of #8
					into a “keep it simple '' quiet area/meditation hall. It can be a room where a person can
					just be in silence. Its a “keep it simple” space, an open room without furniture and with
					a few meditation cushions and yoga mats in it on the floor. We plan to line the walls with
					cedar planks which have a nice smell and quality very different than most of the adobe and
					stone walls and it will have a very clean and uplifting feeling. #8 is called the infinite
					wash room because, not only can you do your laundry in half, the apartment, but you can
					wash your mind in the keep it simple room. We want to start with #8 as the first project.
				</p>

		</div>

		<div id="six">
			<Frame>
				<p>
					APT #6. We call this apartment <span>The Secret corner</span> <br />
					The corner one bedroom apartment, and it is the only one bedroom in the older section of the
					building. Because it is a one bedroom and has a very functional quiet unique layout it would
					be great for visiting Asian Doctors teachers, honored guests. This Apartment needs new flooring
					and painting and little patchwork here and there. It has been used as a crash pad for work-stay
					people already so it is functional but not at the level it can be at so we would like to put
					it more on the top of the list for remodel. It is probably the easiest to remodel.
				</p>
			</Frame>
		</div>
		<div id="three">
			<Frame>
				<p>
					APT #3. This apartment is called <span>Magic 3</span><br />

					We just cleared out #3 as it was used as a storage unit for the last 40 years and other
					than newer electricity, it has not been upgraded in its style since the 1940’s. So this
					one needs a total facelift. That means totally new floors throughout the back wall patched
					newly built kitchen counter and sink area. This will take more work but it is also up
					there in our priorities probably equal to #6 in importance since it is on the wing of the
					building more for Tenants it would be great to rent it out to a local person for income
					for the property and to pay for more remodeling of the other units.
				</p>
			</Frame>
		</div>
		<div id="four">
			<Frame>
				<p>
					Apartment #4 is called <span>4 Immeasurables</span> <br /> It has always had very compassionate
					tenants, but one just had to move so it is empty. It needs remodeling but it is functional
					for guests at the moment.
				</p>

				<p>
					It is on the wing of the building that is great for local tenants to rent but it needs to
					be cleaned and maybe repainted, but it is more or less ready to rent out to the right
					person.
				</p>
			</Frame>
		</div>
		<div id="seven">
			<Frame>
				<p>
					Apartment #7, is called <span>Lucky #7</span> <br />
					It will eventually be converted to a bunk bed style dorm room area. It needs remodeling but
					it is functional and one of the larger studio type apartments.
				</p>
			</Frame>
		</div>

		<div id="main_house">
			<Frame>
				<p>
					Main house. We call this <span>The Holistic House</span>. <br />The laundry room is half
					of what used to be a converted garage. Will be moving the laundry room to #8 and rejoining
					that room with the rest of the garage space to become a large bedroom. The rear secondary
					kitchen will be fixed up. The front of the house will have an asian medicine herbal supply
					store and waiting room for acupuncture and herbal patients. It will also have an eating
					area for sharing food after cooking classes. The middle acupuncture treatment room will
					stay the same but a room in the front will be added for a second acupuncture treatment
					room. We will be taking away the middle west facing bedroom to be able to enlarge the
					kitchen in the mail house. The entire house needs reflooring and or carpeting depending
					what room and other slight repairs. The attic needs floor boards and more insulation in
					some spot which will allow for a lot of storage space. The house has a great structure and
					one the laundry room is moved, the back area will be its own separate living space or
					“grandma apartment,” with its own bedroom bathroom and separate kitchen,

					6 of the other apartments are not being remodeled. #1 <span>The outpost</span>, #2
					<span>Deuces are wild</span>, #5 <span>Rainbow Energy</span>, #9
					<span>Transcendent Beatles</span>, #10 <span>Ordinary Ground</span>, and #11
					<span>Liberty Palace</span>. All but one of these, Transcendent Beatles, are currently
					occupied by local tenants and they want to continue renting and will not be getting any
					renovations at this time. So right now we only have #9 open for guests and visitors, and
					although they are up for remodeling and not as nice #4 and #6 and #7 are also open for
					helpers to stay in while we work to upgrade one step at a time.

		<div id="back">
			<Frame
				><p>
					Back of property. The north side we hope to a have a roofed walkway, which add another 10
					feet extending out from the buildings roof. We will make it out of used solar panels (we
					know where to get them) it is north, On opposite side of walk way facing south we will add
					a few storage sheds rentable to tenants. Thus this sort of encloses the walkway and
					provides shade to the back of the building and protect the building from storms. The north
					side building is very strong and has survived well for almost 100 years but the outer
					screens on the rear windows often get blown off by the wind. This roofed walkway will
					serve all these functions to add value to the property. We will add gravel to get rid of
					the goat head weeds back there the walk way will go all the way to the west back yard. One
					the West side behind the building there are nice shaded trees and we hope to make that a
					nice common area to have for a secluded relaxation in the shade to read books and so on.
					It will have nice garden, grass or stone patio, especially behind #8. On the corner
					between the west and east we might at times put up an above ground pool with a salt water
					system for soaking and bathing.
				</p></Frame

		</div>

		<div id="solar">
			<Frame
				><p>
					Solar Arrays for electric bike charging. All the buildings on the property have great
					durable metal roofs and on them we want to add solar. We also might create our own battery
					banks to charge our electric bikes and vehicle conversions and provide free electricity to
					the apartments. Whether this extra energy connects at all to the grid or not or we just
					use it ourselves is to be determined. We have already repurposed old microwave
					transformers to make lithium battery bank welders when constructing lower price ebike
					batteries. There are a few different types of lithium battery chemistries and we will
					decide what kind of battery banks and do a cost analysis of which will be best for our
					purposes and best to recycle older lithluim batteries. Having battery banks also helps
					everyone here and the larger community if ever in emergencies the city power is disrupted.
				</p>
			</Frame>
		</div>

		<div id="redesign">
			<Frame
				><p>
					Redesigned front entrance way to parking lot and a few minor landscape tweeks. We want to
					build some kind of roofed entrance gate, like a Japanese Sanmon, however it can be very
					simple. We want to add some more decorative planters at the entrance area, and paint the
					totally sun faded sign to say GOMPA APARTMENTS.
				</p></Frame
			>
		</div>

		<div id="repaint">
			<Frame
				><p>
					Repainting outside of all the buildings. We are keeping the white color theme on all the
					apartments, but changing the boarder colors to a faded orange. And the main house we are
					painting that faded orange color. We will use decorative art on the posts and boarder
					accents, maybe more of a tibetan or asian style motif. A friend from boulder has
					volunteered to do some of that specialty artistic painting.
